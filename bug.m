In Objective-C, a tricky error can occur when dealing with memory management using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and properties declared without specifying the `strong`, `weak`, or `copy` attributes.  If you don't explicitly specify the memory management semantics, the compiler might assign a default attribute that doesn't align with your expectations, leading to unexpected retain cycles or premature object deallocation. For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic) AnotherClass *anotherObject; // Implicitly 'strong'
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.anotherObject = [[AnotherClass alloc] init];
    // ... later, if self is deallocated, anotherObject will also be deallocated
}
@end
```

In this case, the `anotherObject` property is implicitly 'strong', creating a retain cycle if `anotherObject` also holds a strong reference to `self`. The unexpected deallocation might occur if the compiler's default is `weak` but you need a `strong` reference.  Debugging this requires careful examination of reference counts and property attributes.
